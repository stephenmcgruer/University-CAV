# Computer Animation & Visualization

This repository contains my coursework for the 4th Year [Computer Animation & Visualization](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/tkomura/cav/) course, taken in 2011/2012. There were two pieces of coursework during the CAV course: the first involved implementing a system to perform skin-to-skeleton rigging and kinematics, while the second involved processing three dimensional data for better user interaction.

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
